# Cinnabar
A Genshin version of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

It's called Cinnabar as Spindle rhymes with Wordle.

## Rules

Position doesn't matter.

- Green means that it was the correct character.

- Yellow means that the guess was the correct element.

- Grey means that the neither the element nor the character was correct.

## Usage

Run `main.py` to play the game. The code has some features that require Python 3.9 or above.

The spelling of the guesses has to be exact to what the character shows in English or one of their aliases in the data file. This includes whitespaces and capitalisation.

For the different travelers, they are spelled `Anemo Traveler`, `Geo Traveler`, and `Electro Traveler` (note: Traveler can be shortened to `AMC`, `GMC`, or `EMC`). Any future travelers can be expected to have been spelled in a similar fashion.
